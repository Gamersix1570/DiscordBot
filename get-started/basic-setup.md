# Basic Setup

Before getting started we need to prepare a permanent coding environment, isn't it?&#x20;

_All of this process should be one time process to do, for countless discord bots to create in your imagination. Let's get straight into it._

{% hint style="info" %}
Feel free to skip this section if you already have this one-time-setup configured on your local device.
{% endhint %}

### Short and Sweet Context:

1. Installing A [Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com) ([**Visual Studio Code - Most Recommended**)](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (To manage [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). based discord bots)
3. Installing Git (Either [Git CLI](https://cli.github.com) or Basic [Git Scm](https://git-scm.com))

## Installing Visual Studio Code

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This guide is based on Visual Studio Code only. **We strongly recommend you using Visual Studio Code because it is free to use, open source - and runs everywhere. What else you need?
{% endhint %}

Visual Studio Code runs everywhere. You know what to do, and how to install an application. ~~_(Like seriously if you don't know, why are you even trying to code when you get no knowledge of basic computer softwares)_~~

_<mark style="color:red;">Bring the habit to read docs. You will suffer later otherwise.</mark>_

## Installing Node.js

Node.js is your environment of coding discord bots based on discord.js.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**DO NOT INSTALL LTS NODE VERSION! **You have been warned. Discord.js requires at least Node.js 16.x and above in order to work. **You have to download the "Current" aka latest version that is above 16.**
{% endhint %}

Get started downloading Node.js at the below link and install it as you do for other packages or applications based on your operating system.

## Installing Git

You have a choice to either install [Git-Scm](https://git-scm.com) or [Git CLI](https://cli.github.com). Both are equally good (as per my opinion), but still I do recommend using Git CLI over Git-Scm ~~_(Ignoring the fact that I use Git-Scm)_~~ So yeah!

{% embed url="https://github.com/cli/cli#installation" %}
Git CLI Installation Steps as per their readme. I'm sure why should I copy it if it already exists there.

{% embed url="https://git-scm.com/downloads" %}
Git-Scm Downloads - Install like you did for Node.js

#### And that was all, I guess

If you have made till here, congratulations! _You might not need to visit this page again anymore. _

Let's continue to \*_actually\* _making a discord bot of your dreams!
