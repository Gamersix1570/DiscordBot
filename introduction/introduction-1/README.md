# Introduction

If you are reading this, probably, you have some interest in making discord bots. In this detailed documentation, you will be learning to make your very personal `discord.js` bot. It's awesome, I bet.

I'll cover up:

* Prototypes of making discord bots,
* Mind maps,
* Concepts,
* Environments of coding,
* And much more...

## Before we begin...

Alright, making a bot is cool and all, but there are some prerequisites to it. To create a bot with discord.js, you should have a fairly decent grasp of JavaScript itself. While you _can_ make a bot with very little JavaScript and programming knowledge, trying to do so without understanding the language first will only hinder you. You may get stuck on many uncomplicated issues, struggle with solutions to incredibly easy problems, and all-in-all end up frustrated. Sounds pretty annoying.

If you don't know JavaScript but would like to learn about it, here are a few links to help get you started:

* [Eloquent JavaScript, a free online book(opens new window)](http://eloquentjavascript.net)
* [JavaScript.info, a modern javascript tutorial(opens new window)](https://javascript.info)
* [CodeCademy's interactive JavaScript course(opens new window)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
* [Nodeschool, for both JavaScript and Node.js lessons(opens new window)](https://nodeschool.io)
* [MDN's JavaScript guide and full documentation(opens new window)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Google, your best friend(opens new window)](https://google.com)

Take your pick, learn some JavaScript, and once you feel like you're confident enough to make a bot, come back and get started!
